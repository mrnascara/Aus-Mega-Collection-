Platforms supported: Windows for arm & Windows 64 bit, I think win 7 & newer will work,but I haven’t tested it at all so be at your own risk…..now you may be wondering…WHY ARE THERE EMPTY FOLDERS…it’s annoying to switch tabs over & over,also there could be bugs which could delay the process so fyi - this is a mega collection of a couple of scratch games I made + 2 more that aren’t on scratch

note:the html.zip file just contains the .html files,i would have done .exe if exes werent stupid fat for no reason
 -.xz source code file coming soon!
